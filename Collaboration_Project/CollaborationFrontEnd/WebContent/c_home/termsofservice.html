			<li>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and
				use of the services, websites, and applications offered by
				MingleBox, Inc. ("MingleBox") (the "Service"). Your access to and
				use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and
				compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Service you
				agree to be bound by these Terms.</li>
			<li>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding
				contract with MingleBox, and only in compliance with these Terms and
				all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules
				and regulations. You must provide us accurate information, including
				your real name, when you create your account on MingleBox. We may,
